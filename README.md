## Development 🚀

###  Classification Model 🏆
In our experiment, we explored the performance of four different classification models: EfficientNetB0 <a href="#ref-10"> [10] </a>, EfficientNetB2, VGGFace <a href="#ref-13"> [13] </a>, and ResNet50 <a href="#ref-14"> [14] </a>. We evaluated these models on three distinct datasets: LFW , Celebrity, and Personal. Each dataset provided a unique set of challenges and variations in facial images.

🔍 We systematically combined each model with every dataset to observe the resulting accuracy and loss. By examining the combination of models with different datasets, we aimed to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each model in different contexts.

**In the following table, we trained the models for 50 epochs and observed:**
![Experiment Results](images/exp.png)

📈 Based on our comprehensive evaluation of the four classification models—EfficientNetB0, EfficientNetB2, VGGFace, and ResNet50—in combination with the LFW, Celebrity, and Personal datasets, we have determined that EfficientNetB2 is the most suitable model for our intended application. Through rigorous analysis, we found that EfficientNetB2 consistently achieved high accuracy and demonstrated remarkable performance across multiple datasets.

💪 EfficientNetB2 exhibited superior results on both the Celebrity and Personal datasets, indicating its ability to capture intricate facial features and adapt well to various image variations. Its impressive performance, combined with its efficiency in terms of computational resources, makes EfficientNetB2 an ideal choice for our facial recognition task.

✅ Considering the importance of accuracy, generalization capabilities, and computational efficiency, we have made an informed decision to employ EfficientNetB2 as our primary classification model for the proposed application. This selection ensures a reliable and efficient facial recognition system that can effectively handle diverse real-world scenarios.

**Test Accuracy for EfficientNet-B2 on the three datasets:**

**Test Loss for EfficientNet-B2 on the three datasets:**

###  Embedding 🧠
🎭 As another powerful technique, we delved into face embedding—a process that transforms a face image into a high-dimensional feature representation. This representation, known as an embedding, captures the unique characteristics of a face and facilitates measuring similarities or distances between faces.

🔍 In our experiments, we harnessed the potential of a Siamese network architecture combined with the triplet loss function. The Siamese network comprises three identical subnetworks, sharing the same weights. Taking three face images as input, it produces their corresponding embeddings. The triplet loss function then trains the network by minimizing the distance between an anchor face embedding and a positive (same identity) face embedding, while maximizing the distance between the anchor face embedding and a negative (different identity) face embedding.

![Face Embedding](images/emb.png)

**Triplet Loss Formula:**
loss = max(0, ||A-P||^2 - ||A-N||^2 + α)

where:
- A: Anchor embedding vector
- P: Positive embedding vector
- N: Negative embedding vector
- α: Margin that determines the minimum separation between positive and negative pairs

😕 The naive approach in face recognition involves randomly selecting triplets for training the embedding model without considering the difficulty of the samples. In this case, the model learns from triplets that may not provide sufficient discriminative information, leading to suboptimal performance.

🚀 To overcome this challenge, we embraced the online triplet approach, dynamically selecting hard triplets during training. A hard triplet consists of an anchor, a positive (same identity) sample, and a negative (different identity) sample that are challenging to distinguish. By focusing on hard triplets, the model is pushed to learn more robust and discriminative embeddings.

🏆 As our experiments progressed, we encountered difficulties in achieving optimal performance solely with our custom-built network architecture. To overcome this, we decided to harness the power of transfer learning and adopted the FaceNet<a href="#ref-18"> [18] </a> pretrained model. FaceNet is a widely recognized face recognition model trained on a large-scale dataset, demonstrating outstanding performance in embedding faces into a high-dimensional space. By leveraging the FaceNet model, we achieved higher accuracy and benefited from its robust features.
